We assessed the use of a microswitch-based program for promoting ambulation responses by
two children with multiple disabilities. The goals of the study were to: (a) evaluate the impor-
tance of the contingency between the target behavior (forward step) and the programmed conse-
quence (preferred stimuli), (b) measure effects of the intervention on indices of happiness, and
(c) assess the social validation of the procedure using 20 physiotherapists as external raters. The
intervention involved the automatic delivery of preferred stimuli contingent on forward steps.
Results showed that both participants improved their performance (forward steps and indices of
happiness) during contingent reinforcement phases compared to baseline and noncontingent
reinforcement phases. Moreover, physiotherapists rated the intervention as socially valid.

quality of life (Dillon & Carr, 2007; Lancioni,
Singh, O’Reilly, Oliva, & Basili, 2005). One
possible feature of quality of life is happiness,
which Felce and Perry (1995) noted may
include pleasure, satisfaction, well-being, and
fulfillment. These constructs are, however, dif-
ficult to measure, especially with nonverbal
populations. Therefore, researchers have meas-
ured behavioral indices of happiness such as
smiling, laughing, and energized body move-

resulting measures have been referred to as
indices of happiness (Lancioni, Singh, et al.,
2006; Perilli, Lancioni, Hoogeveen, et al.,
2013; Stasolla, Caffo,
Bosco, 2013).

Traditional intervention strategies for gait
and posture disorders, largely based on
Bobath’s paradigm, outline the relevance of

Picucci, &

preventing abnormal movements and facilitat-
ing postural maneuvers through  therapist-
directed practice of preparatory motor
responses (Bobath & Bobath, 1984). An alter-
native point of view is represented by a child-
centered strategy that enhances ambulation by
encouraging the child to practice such behavior
(Palisano, 2010). One approach involves the
use of a treadmill matched with partial body
weight maintenance. Supporting both of these
aspects may be crucial to facilitate ambulation,
especially among those who present with multi-
ple disabilities, including severe motor impair-
ments (Dewar, Love, & Johnston, 2015).
These two strategies rely mainly on caregivers’
assistance and do not necessarily involve teach-
ing specific behavioral responses aimed at pro-
moting independent locomotor behavior.
Another approach is based on the use of
walker devices linked to microswitches and
contingent stimuli. The devices include sup-
ports that contribute to postural control and
balance such as four-wheeled walkers with seats
and baskets. The microswitches allow for the
automatic delivery of a brief period of preferred

ferred stimuli through a system control unit
(Lancioni et al., 2009).

The literature on the use of microswitches
and contingent stimuli for promoting ambu-
lation responses among pediatric populations
is substantial (Lancioni et al., 2010, 2013;
Lancioni, Singh, O'Reilly,
Alberti,et al. 2014). Previous

studies have

FABRIZIO STASOLLA et al.

shown the effectiveness of microswitch use
among individuals with multiple disabilities
(Lancioni & Singh, 2014; Perilli, Lancioni,
Laporta, et al., 2013). For instance, Lancioni
et al. (2010) exposed five children to a
microswitch-based program (MBP) aimed at
promoting locomotion. For all participants,
the mean frequencies of steps increased dur-
ing intervention phases compared to baseline.
Recently, Lancioni et al. (2013) implemented
a MBP for two children with multiple dis-
abilities. For the first participant, the target
response was a forward step and for the sec-
ond participant, the target
pushing himself forward with both feet while
he was seated on the walker saddle. For both
participants, performance was enhanced dur-

response Was

ing intervention phases.

Although largely encouraging, three impor-
tant features are missing from the aforemen-
tioned studies on ambulation: (a) an evaluation
of the effects of such interventions on positive
affect (i.e., indices of happiness, except for the
study by Lancioni et al., 2013); (b) an analysis
of the importance of the reinforcement contin-
gency (i.e., it is possible that noncontingent
reinforcement might be equally effective); and
(c) a social validation assessment involving
experts as external raters.

First, indices of happiness as a measure of
quality of life have been investigated in previ-
ous studies targeting other behaviors (Stasolla,
Damiani, Perilli, et al., 2014; Stasolla, De Pace
et al., 2014; Stasolla, Perilli et al., 2015). The
basic assumption is that through an MBP, an
individual with multiple disabilities is provided
with the ability to independently access pre-
ferred stimuli, and it is reasonable to assume
that this would lead to increases in indices of
happiness, but this remains unknown.

The relevance of the reinforcement contin-
gency is also unknown. Lancioni et al. (2003)
evaluated whether increases in responding
(turning head sideways and knee-weaving as a
fast/wide left-to-right movement of the left
MICROSWITCHES AND AMBULATION RESPONSES

knee) of three adolescents with profound multi-
ple disabilities depended on the contingency
between their responses and preferred stimuli
rather than the mere presentation of stimuli.
The authors evaluated responding across base-
line, contingent reinforcement, and noncontin-
gent reinforcement phases. All participants
showed increases in responding only during
contingent reinforcement phases, suggesting
that the reinforcement contingency, rather than
stimulus presentation per se, accounted for the
intervention effects. However, the importance
of the reinforcement contingency has not been
evaluated with ambulation responses.

Third, in order to fully evaluate the rehabili-
tative value of an intervention program, it is
arguably important to include experts from rel-
evant fields in social validation assessments.
Although social validation assessments have
been conducted in a number of previous stud-
ies (e.g., Lancioni, O'Reilly, et al., 2006), no
study on MBP interventions with ambulation
responses has included expert ratings of social
validity. This procedure of social validation via
expert raters is commonly used within the
assistive technology approach to corroborate
the clinical value of the proposed intervention
(Caffo et al., 2014; Stasolla, Caffo et al., 2015;
Stasolla & De Pace, 2014).

The purpose of the current study was to sys-
and extend previous
research by (a) measuring the effects of a

tematically replicate
microswitch-based intervention on number of
steps taken and of happiness,
(b) evaluating the effects of contingent versus

indices

noncontingent reinforcement on number of
steps and positive affect, and (c) assessing social
validation using 20 physiotherapists as external
raters.

METHOD

Participants and Setting
Jill and Melissa were 5 and 6 years old,
respectively. Due to congenital encephalopathy

347

and perinatal hypoxia, both presented with
speech deficits, a lack of sphincter control, and
drooling, but were capable of some functional
vocalizations aimed at requesting caregivers’
attention. They spent about 14 hours per day
sitting and were totally dependent on caregivers
for their daily personal needs. No IQ scores
were available, because no formal test was feasi-
ble. However, from clinical observations, the
participants were estimated to have severe to
profound intellectual disabilities. Both partici-
pants attended a regular class (ie., one that
includes typically developing children) with
special assistance, in which they worked on
individualized programs. The children received
physiotherapeutic and sensorial stimulation ses-
sions twice a week (Jill) and 4 days per week
(Melissa); each was capable of some ambulation
responses with their walker device (Invacare
rollator walker, model 65650). Parents and
caregivers considered the rehabilitative program
highly desirable and signed a formal consent
for participation and for video-recordings of
sessions. [he intervention was approved by a
local ethics and scientific committee and carried
out according to Helsinki Declaration and its
later amendments.

The study was carried out at home for Jill
and within the medical center for Melissa. In
both settings, the sessions took place in a 4 x
5 m room, which did not contain any physical
barriers.

Apparatus

The technology included an adapted micro-
switch optic sensor (ie., circular photocell,
2 cm in diameter) fixed on the walker’s front
left side, and a 50 x 40 cm reflector panel fixed
on the front right side of the walker. The
walker had four wheels, a hand grip, a brake
handle, a back support, a seat, a basket, and an
adjustable knob, which controlled the walker’s
seat. By performing a step with one foot, the
light beam between the optic sensor on one
348

side and the reflector panel on the other was
interrupted and an adaptive response was auto-
matically recorded by the system. Micro-
switches were connected to a battery-powered
control unit system attached to the walker
device. This system had three functions: to
(a) count the number of steps, (b) ignore
(i.e, not count) a step response within the
stimulation period (i.e., 3 s, see experimental
conditions below), and (c) turn on preferred
stimuli during contingent reinforcement phases
(Lancioni et al., 2004, Lancioni, O’Reilly,
et al., 2007). To deliver preferred stimuli, the
walker devices were equipped with compact
disc players, positioned behind the photocell
and the reflector panel along the left and right
sides of the walker. Additionally, lights and tac-
tile vibrations were fixed on the vertical bar in
front of the participant and visible to her.

Measurement and Data Collection

Data were collected on the number of for-
ward steps and indices of happiness. Forward
steps were automatically recorded by the appa-
ratus as described Happiness was
defined as smiling, laughing, or having excited

and energized body, leg or arm movements,
with or without vocalizations (depending on
the participant). Observers scored indices of
happiness according to a 15-s partial interval
coding system, in which 10 s of observation
were followed by a 5-s scoring interval. During
the 5-s interval, the observers scored whether
any of the indices of happiness had been pres-
ent or absent during the previous 10-s interval.
At the beginning of each session, a research
assistant provided a verbal prompt to “walk."
The prompted response was subtracted from
the total number of responses counted within
the session.

Interobserver Agreement (IOA)
To obtain interobserver agreement (IOA) for
indices of happiness, two observers collected

FABRIZIO STASOLLA et al.

data simultaneously, but independently, for
40% of the video-recorded sessions. An agree-
ment was scored if both observers recorded the
presence or the absence of an index of happi-
ness within an observed interval. Otherwise, a
disagreement was recorded. Specifically, agree-
ments for both the presence and the absence of
indices of happiness were calculated as a unique
index. Mean IOA, calculated by dividing the
number of agreements by the total number of
intervals and multiplying the quotient by
100, was 96% (range 93% to 100%), and
Cohen’s & was .96.

For the preference assessment (see below),
IOA was obtained for all of the five sessions. If
the observers scored the participants’ reaction
to the stimuli identically, an agreement was
scored. Otherwise, a disagreement was scored.
Interobserver agreement was calculated by
dividing the number of agreements by the
number of agreements and disagreements and
multiplying the quotient by 100. The mean
IOA was 98% (range 95% to 100%) and
Cohen’s & was .98.

Procedures

Preference assessment. Combined with an
informal interview with participants’ parents, a
formal screening of preference was carried out
(Crawford & Schuster, 1993). This approach
has been widely adopted when assessing prefer-
ences among individuals with multiple disabil-
ities (Lancioni, Sigafoos, O'Reilly, & Singh,
2012). Five sessions were conducted. During
those sessions, two research assistants, seated at
the participants’ right and left, provided 8-10 s
of stimulus presentation followed by a 15-20 s
break. The sessions lasted 5 min and included
10 to 15 stimulus presentations. The research
assistants presented stimuli belonging to three
main categories (visual, auditory, and tactile)
randomly and nonconsecutively. Stimuli that
evoked a positive reaction, such as gaze orienta-
tion towards the stimulus source, smiling
MICROSWITCHES AND AMBULATION RESPONSES

and/or alert responses for at least 70% of pre-
sentations, were retained. Popular music, famil-
iar voices, colored lights, and vibrations were
selected for both participants based on the
results of the preference assessment.

Experimental design and general procedures.
We evaluated treatment effects using a reversal
design embedded in a nonconcurrent multiple
baseline design across participants (Tate et al.,
2016). The basic criterion for switching from
one phase to the next was trend stability. We
conducted three sessions per day, 4 days per
week (except for baseline, during which four
sessions per day were conducted). All sessions
were video-recorded. Every session began when
a research assistant provided a verbal prompt to
the participant: "Come on, let’s walk." Session
duration was 5 min. A 10- to 15-min rest
period was provided between sessions.

Baseline. During baseline, the microswitches
and control system unit were present, but a for-
ward step did not produce any programmed
consequences. In each of the two baselines,
four sessions were conducted for Jill within
1 day, and eight sessions for Melissa over
2 days.

Contingent reinforcement (B). During the
four contingent reinforcement phases, each for-
ward step registered by the optic sensors pro-
duced 3 s of access to five preferred stimuli
simultaneously and automatically. If the partici-
pant took another step within 3 s, the second
step did not result in the presentation of pre-
ferred stimuli, because stimulus presentation
resulting from the first step was still ongoing.

Noncontingent reinforcement (C). This phase
identical to the intervention phase
described above, with the exception that the

WaS

preferred stimuli were presented on a time-
based schedule, independent of forward steps.
Thus, the contingency between the preferred
stimuli and the target behavior was removed.
The schedule of stimulus presentation was
based on the mean rate of contingent stimulus
delivery during the two previous intervention

349

phases. For example, if a participant had per-
formed 60 steps on average per session, the
stimulation would be delivered on a variable-
time schedule of 5 s. Thus, a mean interstimu-
lus interval of 5 s would separate each 3-s stim-
ulus presentation. The stimulus presentation in
this phase was controlled by a research assis-
tant. Whenever the provision of the noncontin-
gent reinforcement by the research assistant
coincided with a forward step, the stimulus
presentation was postponed for 2 s (Lancioni
et al., 2003).

Social validation assessment. Twenty phy-
siotherapists, with a mean age of 39.6 years
(SD = 6.4, range 27-55) served as external
raters in a social validation assessment. They
were recruited within a local medical center for
disabilities.
They represented a convenience sample of pro-
fessionals interested in the field of severe to
profound developmental and multiple disabil-
ities; Khetani, 2015). They were expected to be
sensitive to the topic and have an expertise ade-

individuals with developmental

quate to assess the videos. The physiotherapists
were randomly divided into two groups of 10.
The first group assessed Jill’s performance, and
the second group assessed Melissa’s perfor-
mance. Each group watched a typical 3-min ses-
sion from a contingent-reinforcement phase and
a typical 3-min session from a noncontingent-
reinforcement phase. Half of the raters in each
group were exposed to a contingent reinforce-
ment session followed by noncontingent rein-
the other half was
exposed to the opposite sequence. They were
asked to rate the videos using a five-item ques-

forcement session and

tionnaire (see Table 1). The questionnaire
included a 5-point Likert scale, in which 1 repre-
sented the least favorable rating and 5 repre-
sented the most favorable rating.

phase, the frequency of forward steps averaged
8.5 (range, 6-10). The average number of for-
ward steps per session increased to 74.7 (range,
40-100) during the first intervention phase.
Subsequently, her performance decreased dur-
ing the second baseline to 23.5 steps on average
(range 20-28). During the second contingent
reinforcement phase, Jill’s mean number of
steps increased again to 77.1 (range, 50-100).
During the first noncontingent reinforcement
phase, Jill’s mean number of steps decreased to
36.4 (range, 30-49), but increased again to
74 (range, 48-94) during the third intervention
phase. Finally, her mean number of steps
decreased during the second noncontingent
reinforcement phase to 27.5 (range, 24-32),
and increased again to 78.1 (range, 56-90)
within the last intervention phase.

Melissa’s numbers of steps are shown in the
lower panel of Figure 1. During baseline, her
mean frequency of forward steps was 5.5 steps
(range, 4-9). In the first intervention phase,
her mean number of steps increased to 78.2
(range, 35-100). Subsequently, steps decreased
to a mean of 16.9 (range, 10-25) in the second
baseline, and again increased to 79 (range,
42-92) within the second intervention phase.
Her mean number of steps decreased to 30.9
(range, 20-45) in the first noncontingent rein-
forcement phase, and increased again to 80.7

(range 54-95) in the third intervention phase.
Finally, Melissa’s steps decreased to a mean
number of 31.2 (range, 28-34) during the sec-
ond noncontingent reinforcement phase and
increased to 77.3 (range, 58-90) in the last
intervention phase.

Jill's happiness measures are displayed in the
upper panel of Figure 2. In baseline, Jill’s per-
centage of intervals with indices of happiness
averaged 13.8% (range, 10%—20%). Similar to
the number of steps, indices of happiness
increased during the first intervention phase,
up to an average of 77.6% (range, 60%-—
100%). The mean percentage decreased to
31.3% (range, 25%—45%) within the second
baseline and then increased to 72.4% (range,
60%-95%) during the second contingent rein-
forcement phase. Jill’s indices of happiness
decreased to an average of 42.5% of intervals
(range, 25%-55%) during the first noncontin-
gent reinforcement phase and increased to an
average of 73% (range, 60%—85%) during the
third contingent reinforcement phase. Jill’s
average indices of happiness decreased to 38%
(range 30%-G0%) in the second noncontin-
gent reinforcement phase and increased to a
mean of 81.3% (range, 70%—95%) in the final
intervention phase.

percentage of intervals with positive mood was
9.4% (range, 5%-15%). Her mean indices of
happiness increased to 73.1% (range, 50%—

to 23.1 (range, 10%—40%) in the second base-
line, and increased again to 71.9% (range,

All differences between baseline, contingent
reinforcement interventions, and noncontin-
gent reinforcement phases were statistically sig-
nificant (p < .05) according to Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests (Ross & Begeny, 2014) for both
participants for both dependent measures. Fur-
thermore, the noncontingent reinforcement
phases resulted in average frequencies of target
behaviors that were higher compared to the
baseline phases but lower compared to the con-
tingent reinforcement phases for both
participants.

Means and standard deviations of the social
validation assessment are presented in Table 1.
The differences between intervention and non-
contingent reinforcement, assessed with paired
t-tests, were statistically significant for all items
of the questionnaire (p < .01). All raters scored
the intervention condition (contingent presen-
tation of preferred stimuli) more positively than
the noncontingent reinforcement condition on
all questionnaire items.

DISCUSSION

The results of the current study show that a
microswitch-based program involving contin-
gent presentation of preferred stimuli can be

353

effective in increasing independent walking in
children with multiple disabilities and motor
impairments, with concurrent beneficial effects
on affect (i.e., indices of happiness). For both
Jill and Melissa, the contingency between steps
and environmental consequences seemed to be
the operative variable. This was suggested by
the decrease in the number of steps and in pos-
itive affect when preferred stimuli were pre-
sented noncontingently. Furthermore, social
validation raters endorsed the program more so
there
between walking and accessing preferred stimu-
lation. These findings are in line with the

when was a contingency arranged

results of previous studies targeting adaptive
behavior (Lancioni et al., 2009, 2012; Sta-
solla & Caffo, 2013). The positive effects and
greater acceptability of contingent versus non-
contingent reinforcement are also consistent
with Gabor, Fritz, Roath, Rothe, and Gourley
(2016); Hanley, Piazza, Fisher, Contrucci, and
Maglieri (1997), and Luczynski and Hanley
(2009, 2010) who described similar findings in
the context of treating socially mediated prob-
lem behavior, thus corroborating the generality
of process and suggesting the following
implications.

These results may be considered a systematic
replication and _ extension of Lancioni
et al. (2010) and Lancioni, Singh, O'Reilly,
Sigafoos, Renna, et al. (2014) who emphasized
the role of microswitches and contingent stim-
ulation for promoting ambulation responses
among individuals with multiple disabilities.
Unlike these previous studies, the current study
included a control condition in which preferred
stimuli were delivered noncontingently. The
inclusion of this condition permits the evalua-
tion of behavior in the absence of a contin-
gency between responses and stimuli. The
current results strongly suggest that the increase
in steps and indices of happiness was due to
the contingency between responses (i.e., steps)
and environmental consequences (i.e., preferred
stimuli) and not due to the stimulation per
354

se. In fact, the frequency of both participants’
forward steps decreased within both noncontin-
gent reinforcement phases. It is likely that the
removal of the contingency resulted in extinc-
tion of forward steps, although the omission
contingency arranged to avoid adventitious
reinforcement may also have driven down the
number of steps taken in this condition. Con-
sequently, when contingent stimuli were no
longer provided and the number of steps
decreased, indices of happiness also decreased.
The impact of the intervention on indices of
happiness is also consistent with previous
research. Indices of happiness covaried with
suggesting that participants

locomotion,

involving contingent reinforcement, as corrobo-
rated by previous works (Lancioni, Singh,
O’Reilly, Sigafoos, Renna, et al., 2014; Sta-
solla 8 Caffo, 2013; Stasolla, Damiani, &
Caffo, 2014). Moreover, the current approach
(i.e., microswitch-based program) could be
integrated with other strategies previously used
(i.e., Bobath’s model and treadmill). Although
the technology used in the present study is rela-
tively cheap (i-e., $500), one may assume that
when resources are limited in terms of both
availability and costs, physiotherapy will be
adopted. Otherwise, assistive technology is
(Damiano, 2014).
researchers could also directly compare these
different approaches (i.e., physiotherapy/tradi-

treadmill and

recommended Future

tional assistive technology
interventions).

Social raters favorably scored the use of the
assistive technology and evaluated the contin-
gent phases more positively compared to the
noncontingent condition as to corroborate the
intervention clinical validity. However, it
would be important to assess the opinions of
other important caregivers as well as the partici-
pants (see Hanley, 2010). Therefore, future
researchers should extend the social validation
assessments to include both participants’ prefer-
checks and other groups

FABRIZIO STASOLLA et al.

(e.g., parents, students and practitioners; Lan-
cioni, O’Reilly et al., 2006; Stasolla, Perilli, &
Damiani, 2014).

Similar results were obtained with two parti-
cipants in two different settings (home and
medical center). This suggests that the positive
outcomes may have generality beyond clinical
settings (Vorndran & Lerman, 2006). How-
ever, setting generality was not evaluated within
participants, so these findings must be inter-
preted with caution. Future research should
include pre- and postintervention generalization
probes across various settings with individual
participants (Tate et al., 2016). Other relevant
limitations include (a) the absence of partici-
pants with a wide range of disabilities, (b) the
omission of a direct measure of the sedentary
behavior and of a context to evaluate whether
these participants walked more when given the
choice to sit or walk, (c) the absence of the
qualitative aspects of reported locomotion, and
(d) the lack of evidence that there were any
qualitative changes on these participants’ qual-
ity of life following their participation in this
study. In light of these limitations, future
research in this area should involve participants
with multiple disabilities and/or severe to pro-
found developmental disabilities, measurement
of sedentary behavior and locomotion fluency,
and include an additional context to determine
independent participation and effects on quality

of life.
